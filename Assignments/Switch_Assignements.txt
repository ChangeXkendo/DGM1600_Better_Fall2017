A switch statement allows you to compare variables
against different values.


switch(townCenter){


		case "main":

			print("Welcome to Main Street!");

		break;
	
	case "Balcksmith":

			print("The Blacksmith grumbles as you pick through the sword bin.");

		break;

		case "bakery":

			print("Mmmmmmmm hot buttery buns!");

		break;

		case "morgue":

			print("I guess they took an arrow to the knee one too many time...");

		break;

		default:

			print("I don't know what you are talking about!");

		break;
Switch(Armory){
	case "sword":

	break;
	case "mace":
		print("Like to just get the bludgering in I see");
	break;
	default:
		print("Sorry, I don't have that one");
	break;

switch(gems){

An if statment is a conditional phrase that allows you to 
set up situations in which depending on whether it is true or not
can either be one thing or another. Such as if the color of the light 
is red then (option 1) will print, if not (option 2) will and so on.

public string stopLight;

if(stopLight == "Red"){


	print("Stop! The light is red!");


	}


	else if (stopLight == "Yellow"){


		print("Slow Down!");


	}

	else if (stopLight == "Green"){


		print("Green means GO!");


	}


	else if (stopLight == "All Colors"){


		print("Stop, drop, and roll");


	
	}


	else{


		print("I dont know what you mean!");


	}




public string shops = "Black Smith";

	if(shops == "Open"){
		print("What can I do for you?);
	}
	else(shops == "Closed"){
		print("Please come back again");
	}

public string gems = "Loot";

	if(gems == "Blue"){
		print("JACKPOT!");

			public int gold = 1000000000000000;

	}
	else(gems == "Red"){
		print("LOSER!");
			
			public int gold = --10000;
	
	}

public bool banana = True;

	if(banana){
		print("It is a fruit!");

	}
	else(!banana){
		print("you are telling me it is a vegitible?!);
	}

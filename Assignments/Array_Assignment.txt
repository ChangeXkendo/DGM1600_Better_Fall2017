Array's

An array is a variable that holdes multiple values, kind of like a collection.
Although, unlike a variable it has a set type that cannot change. You cannot
have a white egg in a group of brown eggs. Basically it allows you to bunch a
lot of a type of variables together into a group.

Examples

public Brown[] eggs = new Brown [12];



public string[] heros = new string [6];
	heros[0] = "Batman";
	heros[1] = "Superman";
	heros[2] = "Wonder Woman";
	heros[3] = "Green Lantern";
	heros[4] = "Aqua Man";
	heros[5] = "Green Arrow";

public int[] money = new int [5]
	int[0] = 100;
	int[1] = 500;
	int[2] = 1000;
	int[3] = 1500;
	int[4] = 2000;

	print(money[2]);
